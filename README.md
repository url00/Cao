## Cao - Copy and operate ##
This tool's purpose is to create a pipe-like system for work outside of the shell.

Copy some data (text) -> Run script on the copy buffer -> Paste the result.

# Extremely messy notes below #
by convention there will be a single INPUT file containing the data from
the clipboard and a single OUTPUT file for a script/program/whatever to
output to.

Possibly delegate all keyboard input? Trap everything?
Vim like bindings?

Templating would be really nice.
